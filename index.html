      Data shows the collaborations occuring at the Northeastern Visualization
      Lab. Nodes represent members who have worked with at least one other
      member who is a first author. Links represent papers where either of the
      members was a first author on a paper published while they were a member
      of the Northeastern Vis Lab. Click the nodes to go to the members pages or
      follow the links to find the research put out by the collaborators.
